		<h5> What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience? What are your impressions?</h5>
		<p>

		I like how forward thinking and holistic the program is.
		<br>
		<br>I like the idea, which came  up a lot in the Shereef video, about changing your mindset. I am happy to get out of the 'consumer mindset' and in to a 'creator mindset'. This seems like a great idea.

		</p>

		<h5> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
		<p>I see myself doing my very best to engage with all aspects of the course.

		Typically, in study or work, i prefer to forge ahead alone, working independently. I know that the EDA revolves around a lot of pairing or group work, so that will be new.

		 
		 </p>
		<h5> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h5>
		<p>My expectations have not changed at all. I spent a lot of time talking to different people about EDA, so i think my expectations were very realistic.</p>
		<h5> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
		<p>yes excited, and no i am not nervous</p>
